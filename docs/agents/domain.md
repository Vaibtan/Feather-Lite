# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If these files don't exist, proceed silently. The domain-modeling skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repository:

/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept, use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it.
